              <h2>Understanding Inhalant Addiction</h2>
              <p>
                Inhalant addiction occurs when individuals misuse common household substances—such as paint thinners, glues, and aerosols—to achieve a temporary high. These chemicals, often found in easily accessible products, are inhaled to experience mind-altering effects. Inhalants pose serious health risks, including brain damage, organ failure, and sudden death, making this form of addiction particularly dangerous. 
              </p>

              <h2>Signs of Inhalant Addiction</h2>
              <p>
                Recognizing inhalant addiction can be challenging because the signs may be subtle. However, common indicators include:

                </ul>
              </p>

                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <li>Support Groups and 12-Step Programs</li>
                  <p>
                    Peer support is vital in maintaining recovery. Attending groups like Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or inhalant-specific support networks helps individuals build a strong foundation for long-term sobriety.
