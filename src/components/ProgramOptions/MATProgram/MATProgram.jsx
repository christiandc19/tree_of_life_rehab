        <p>
          At Tree Of Life Rehab Center, our Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) program combines FDA-approved medications with counseling and behavioral therapies to provide a comprehensive approach to substance use disorder recovery.

        <h2>What is Medication-Assisted Treatment?</h2>
        <p>
          Medication-Assisted Treatment is an evidence-based approach that uses medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. These medications help normalize brain chemistry, block the euphoric effects of substances, and enable individuals to focus on their recovery.
