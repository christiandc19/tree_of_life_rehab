            <h2>Understanding the Detox Process</h2>
            <p>1. Evaluation <br />The detox process begins with a thorough medical assessment, including physical and psychological evaluations. Our team reviews each patient’s medical history, substance use, and current health status to create a tailored detox plan.</p>
            <p>2. Stabilization <br />Once the plan is established, the patient enters the stabilization phase. During this time, our medical professionals provide care to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings, ensuring the body safely adjusts as substances are cleared.</p>
            <p>3.Transition to Long-Term Treatment <br />After the detox phase, individuals are ready to begin their journey into long-term treatment. Detox alone does not address the underlying psychological aspects of addiction. We help transition patients into comprehensive rehab programs, including therapy and counseling, to support their sustained recovery.</p>
