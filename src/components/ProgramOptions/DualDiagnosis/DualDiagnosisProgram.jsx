        <h2>What is Dual Diagnosis?</h2>
        <p>
          Dual diagnosis, also known as <strong>co-occurring disorders</strong>, occurs when someone experiences both a <strong>mental health condition</strong> such as <strong>depression, anxiety, or PTSD</strong> and a substance use disorder, including <strong>alcohol or drug addiction</strong>. Treating both conditions together is crucial for successful, sustainable recovery.
