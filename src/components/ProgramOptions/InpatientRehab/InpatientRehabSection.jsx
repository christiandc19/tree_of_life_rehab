          <h2>Inpatient Drug Rehab Program Overview:</h2>
          <p>
            <ul>
            <li>24/7 Medical and Emotional Support:Our inpatient drug rehab program offers round-the-clock medical care and emotional support. Addiction specialists, nurses, and therapists are available 24/7 to help manage withdrawal symptoms, monitor progress, and provide individualized care.</li>
            <li>Individualized Treatment Plans: We understand that no two individuals experience addiction in the same way. Our program begins with a thorough assessment to create a personalized treatment plan tailored to each patient's specific needs, including the type of drug addiction, the severity of the condition, and co-occurring mental health disorders.</li>
            <li>Detoxification Services: The first step in recovery is detox. Our experienced medical team ensures a safe and comfortable detox process, using medications and therapies to alleviate the physical and emotional symptoms of withdrawal. The detox phase is monitored closely to ensure patients are stabilized before transitioning into therapy.</li>
            <li>Dual Diagnosis Treatment: Many individuals struggling with addiction also experience co-occurring mental health disorders, such as anxiety, depression, or trauma. Our dual diagnosis program ensures that both addiction and mental health issues are treated simultaneously, giving patients the tools they need to achieve and maintain sobriety.</li>
            <li>Family Therapy and Support: We believe family involvement is critical to recovery. Our inpatient program offers family therapy sessions to help repair relationships and educate loved ones on how to provide effective support. We also offer educational resources and support groups for family members.</li>
